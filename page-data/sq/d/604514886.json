{"data":{"contentfulCompanyInformation":{"about":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"Hello! We are Meese Enterprises, a Maryland-based Limited Liability Corporation that serves a singular purpose: giving you exactly what you want. That's how we chose our tagline, \"Just say the word.\" There was no market research, no brainstorming, and no thinking about it; that's just how we see our company, and that was the first thing that came to mind when we made the decision to incorporate.\n\nOur primary and most popular offering is custom-tailored software for your business or individual needs, but we offer a much wider variety of services that are limited only by the time we are allotted to fulfill your request. We are capable of both B2B and B2C services, and our rates vary based on factors including project complexity, estimated time to completion, and how intriguing your desires are."}},"logo":{"title":"Meese Enterprises Logo","image":{"src":"/_gatsby/image/d7da81292129db2272db39c203bc786d/8c7ce61181d55be2e6bb7bc0ba1ad1f9/MeeseEnterprises_logo.png?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fmli00ose8blz%2F6nf3rNaaVaUqYcoAcciSeC%2Fcac552184036f812d246e417219ab2de%2FMeeseEnterprises_logo.png&a=w%3D450%26h%3D450%26fm%3Dpng%26q%3D100&cd=2022-04-23T20%3A06%3A40.691Z"}}}}}
